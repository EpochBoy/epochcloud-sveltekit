 * Starts OTLP span export, and stops the export queue on server shutdown so the

 *
 * A no-op when no endpoint is set, which keeps local runs off the exporter's
 * retry loop. Service name and resource attributes are not passed here:
 * NodeSDK reads OTEL_SERVICE_NAME and OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES from the
 * environment itself, and the deployment manifests already set both.
 *
 * The endpoint must carry an http:// or https:// scheme. The OTLP gRPC exporter
 * picks insecure credentials only for http://, and defaults a scheme-less value
 * to https://, so a bare host:port silently turns every export into a failed
 * TLS handshake.
