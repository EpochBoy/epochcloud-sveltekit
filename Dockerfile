# git is needed by `vite build`: vite.config.ts stamps the build commit from the
# checked-out .git via `git rev-parse`. Stamping the commit through git (not a
# Docker --build-arg) keeps it out of every layer's cache key - a per-commit
# build-arg value would force a permanent cold dependency rebuild. node:alpine
# ships no git, so install it here (builder stage only; the runtime stage stays slim).

# Copy package files. pnpm-workspace.yaml is required for pnpm 11+ -

# Install the exact pnpm version pinned in package.json's packageManager field,
# via npm and WITHOUT corepack. Two hard constraints, both learned the hard way
# (see git history - do NOT reintroduce corepack here):
#  1. PROXY: build pods are egress-default-deny with a forward proxy injected via
#     env. corepack fetches pnpm with Node's built-in fetch, which ignores
#     HTTP_PROXY and NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY (commits 0d0710e, a3a23ef), so
#     `corepack install` dials registry.npmjs.org directly and the CNI drops it.
#     npm honors the proxy natively, so it is the only fetcher that works here.
#  2. NO SHIM COLLISION: we previously also ran `corepack enable`, which writes a
#     /usr/local/bin/pnpm shim, and this npm install then died with
#     "EEXIST: /usr/local/bin/pnpm" - the build's actual failure. corepack is
#     unused once pnpm is npm-installed, so it is removed entirely; --force keeps
#     this install idempotent against any pnpm shim a future base image ships.
